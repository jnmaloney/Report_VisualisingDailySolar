Daily Solar

Start with all AU
 - Daily output (MW-h)
 - Current output (MW)
 - Targets ? 2020 Emmision target ?
 - (Ability to search for location by name)
 - (Ability to zoom-in one level) 


Categorise by state/territory
 - 1-digit postcode?
 - Daily / Current / Target


[Zoom In]
Categorise by 2-digit postcode



[Individual units]
Show location and capacity/output of individually tracked units.
Overlay on map.




Two data types:
  Pins
  Regions



Notes

Solcast World PV Power API - "for a large number of sites... don't need upload data" Starts at 370USD$

Test sites? Least data req'd for accurate prediction.

Look at S2S4E decision support tool.

postcodes_1618.csv
from APVI
shows capacity of each 4-digit postcode
pot_kw or pot_gwh

*(Actually check the Clean Energy Regulator http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/RET/Forms-and-resources/Postcode-data-for-small-scale-installations)

Algorithm...
For each quad in BOM grid;
Intersects postcode regions with ABS shapefile;
then...
For each postcode;
Sum contributing irradaince from grid (%)
(?) Modulate by capacity
Provide a final estimate per postcode of GWh produced on that day

Meshblocks (!?)


Algorithm...
Shape of each meshblock
Calculate BBox
Iterate 'points' on grid
Each 'point' in shape contributes 1% to the meshblock

From [http://solarenergyfactsblog.com/how-much-solar-energy-is-used-in-the-world/]:
In 2008, the world used about 474 exajoules, or 132,000 TeraWatt hours worth of energy from all sources.


We calculate:
Total:  46,356,420 kWh
ACT 424,464 kWh
NSW 13,710,428 kWh
QLD 13,977,121 kWh
NT 127,861 kWh
SA 6,324,155 kWh
TAS 535,322 kWh
VIC 10,098,863 kWh
WA 1,158,202 kWh

Total:  46,356,420 kWh
Total:  46,356 GWh
Total:  46 TWh per day

(About 1/3 of world energy per year) (???)
