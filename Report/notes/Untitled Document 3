 = Visualising Daily Solar Supply = 

1. Gather the data.
What Data is needed? 
 - Daily solar irradiance (weather)
 - Solar power capacity (# of systems and power)
 - Location data 

What is the process?
 - Gather daily solar irradiance
 - Use location data to cross-reference solar irradiance and capacity
 - Estimate total power output

2. Save the processed data to a cenrtalised system
In a format that we can visualise quickly

3. Visualise the data
