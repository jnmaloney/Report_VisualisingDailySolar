Visualising Daily Solar Supply

What is daily solar supply?
> Investigate the data
> What values are current?

(Why solar)

Significance of daily solar supply
> Rapid shift and uptake
> Meeting 2020 targets
> The effect of weather on daily supply

What is 3D visualisation
> 3D visualisation is naturally tangible
> Is an ideal way to represent spatial data
> Has been successful in the past, in fuels exploration

Why 3D visualisation here
> Focus on immersion and engagement
> The data is existing in a virtual world
> Allow the data to be accessible in context

What are the priorities of the 3D visualisation (Who uses it)
> Home owner with a PV system can compare their output with local average supply
> Large energy projects can see data on a wide scale
> Predict future supply and display for each area

What data sources are useful
> Geographic: Maps, elevation
> Weather: Solar irradiance, cloud cover
> Urban: Postcode-area-supply, capacity

How these data layers might look in a 3D system
> Mockup of what a virtual world could look like

(Previous Findings)
> These are two online tools for geographic planning and solar resources
> Presentation of Planning Tool
> Presentation of Terria

(Previous Findings)
> Academic ideas on virtual worlds
> GML? Level of detail formats...

How we could bring the layers we need into one world?
> Geographic: Geometry (elevation) and texture (map)
> Weather: Cloud geometry based on weather data of area
> Urban: Show features as columns, colouring or billboard time series
